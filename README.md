# ML_Assignments

**Description**: The repo contains solutions to Machine Learning Course (BITS F464) Assignments. All of the code has been written in C from scratch.

### Assignment 1: Candidate Elimination Algorithm
**Description**: The candidate elimination algorithm in Machine Learning is a concept learning algorithm that incrementally builds the version space given a *hypothesis space* H and a set E of *examples*. The result is a set of two hypotheses sets: a specific boundary set and a general boundary set.

### Assignment 2: Decision Tree Learning
**Description**: This includes the implementation of Decision Tree Learning algorithm on a large dataset which includes continuous and missing attributes. As part of the assignment, pruning was also done so as to improve accuracy. Later, Random Forests is implemented which improves the efficiency even further.

**NOTE**

* The codes for both assignments is well-commented, variables and function names have been chosen appropriately so as to enhance readability.

* The dataset and its description can also be found in the respective folders.
